    <h1>Dr. Jaque L. Dupont</h1>
    <p>Dr. Dupont was born in Marrakesh, Morocco in 1953. Shortly after his birth, his family immigrated to the United States where he began school in New Haven, Connecticut. While attending school, Dupont realized there was a lack of education about his home continent of Africa. This eventually led Dupont to attend Oxford where he studied African literature, and later became a leading academic in the field.
